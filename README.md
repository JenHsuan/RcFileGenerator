# RcFileGenerator

    To generate .rc file and head file automatically, I build a utility by using Visual Studio/ C++,
     which was on my Gitbook: https://jenhsuan.gitbooks.io/c-programming/content/chapter4_add_version_to_library_c++_cdll.html
     
     1)Environment: Visual Studio 2008
     2)How to use:
        Explore to Release folder, open terminal and type "RcFileGenerater" and it will ask you
      to input some information, you will see that resource2.h/ version.rc/ AssemblyInfo.cs has been 
      created.
     3)Include files to project: Add resource2.h/ version.rc to your C++ project and rebuild it.
